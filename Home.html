<h1>++Music++</h1>
	<p>I am a huge lover of music! I play the guitar and drums!</p>
	<p>My favorite guitarist is Sam Griffin</p>
	<p>My favorite drummer is Jukka from Nightwish</p>

<h1>++Internet Presence++</h1>
	<p>I love to spend my time online! I have too many accounts to remember.</p>
	<p>I am a twitch affiliate and love to play games on the regular.</p>
	<p>I used to have a youtube and it was pretty active, but stopped due to law changes.</p>

<h1>++Blacksmithing++</h1>
	<p>I own an anvil, forge, foundry and lots of goodies that go with those things.</p> 
	<p>I use these to melt, bend and shape metals.</p>
	<p>Please recycle!</p>

<h1>++Gardening++</h1>
	<p>Just recently my fiance and I have started to grow pepper plants in our driveway.</p> 
	<p>This has been such a good and rewarding experience, with something as rare as tangible</p> 
	<p>payoff like being able to taste the spicy sweet snap of a hardgrown veggie.</p> 
	<p>It's truly difficult not to appreciate it.</p>

<h1>++Probably an Elder God++</h1>
	<p>Not really, I just really enjoy monsters.</p>
