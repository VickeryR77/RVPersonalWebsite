<h1>++Music++</h1>
    <p>
	I am a huge lover of music! I play the guitar and drums!<br/>
	My favorite guitarist is Sam Griffin<br/>
	My favorite drummer is Jukka from Nightwish<br/>
    </p>

<h1>++Internet Presence++</h1>
    <p>
	I love to spend my time online! I have too many accounts to remember.<br/>
	I am a twitch affiliate and love to play games on the regular.<br/>
	I used to have a youtube and it was pretty active, but stopped due to law changes.<br/>
	</p>

<h1>++Blacksmithing++</h1>
    <p>
	I own an anvil, forge, foundry and lots of goodies that go with those things.<br/> 
	I use these to melt, bend and shape metals.<br/>
	Please recycle!<br/>
    </p>

<h1>++Gardening++</h1>
	<p>
	Just recently my fiance and I have started to grow pepper plants in our driveway.<br/> 
	This has been such a good and rewarding experience, with something as rare as tangible<br/> 
	payoff like being able to taste the spicy sweet snap of a hardgrown veggie.<br/>
	It's truly difficult not to appreciate it.<br/>
